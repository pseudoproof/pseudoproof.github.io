## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, advised by [Paul Grubbs](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~paulgrub/).
My research interests lie in computer security and cryptography. I am particularly excited about 
using cryptography to build secure computer systems. My current project focuses on applying 
zero-knowledge proofs to solve security and privacy challenges.
