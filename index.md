## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, advised by Paul Grubbs.
My research interest is in cryptography and computer security, where I focus on building 
and using cryptographic primitives to solve real-world security problems. My current
project focuses on applying zero-knowledge proofs to solve security challenges in managed
networks.
