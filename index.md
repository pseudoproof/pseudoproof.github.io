## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, advised by [Paul Grubbs](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~paulgrub/).

My research interests lie in computer security and cryptography. I am particularly excited about 
using cryptography to build secure computer systems. My current projects focus on applying 
zero-knowledge proofs to solve security and privacy challenges. However, I am always 
interested in exploring new topics in security and cryptography.
